## Features
Window Center & Resizer is a utility application for Windows that allows you to easily center and resize windows on your desktop using customizable keyboard shortcuts. This project is built upon the [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate), which provides a solid foundation for Electron and React development.
